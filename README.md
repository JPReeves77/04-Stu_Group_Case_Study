# JP Morgan Coin
## A Small Case Study 




**How does this company use technology to their advantage? Why are they considered a FinTech company?** 
- JP Morgan Coin leverages blockchain-based technology to enable the instantaneous transfer of payments between institutional clients.
When a client sends money to another over the blockchain, JPM Coins are transferred and instantaneously redeemed for the equivalent amount of U.S. dollars, creating a more efficient transaction betwen parties.
How it works:
    1.) A J.P. Morgan client commits deposits to a designated account and receives an equivalent number of JPM Coins.
    2.) The JPM Coins are used for transactions over a blockchain network with other J.P. Morgan clients (e.g., money movement, payments in securities transactions).
    3.) Lastly, holders of JPM Coins redeem them for USD at J.P. Morgan.
